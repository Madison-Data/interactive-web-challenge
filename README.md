## Belly Button Diversity Homework

In this assignment, you will build an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The dashboard, available here: https://madison-data.github.io/interactive-web-challenge/, allows users to see the composition of belly button bacteria per person sampled (identifiable information not included) as well as how often the person washes their belly button.
